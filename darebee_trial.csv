7	PetiteSheWolf	France	2650	"b""Originally posted by Redline\nView Post\n\nI hear it's good! Did you like it? \n\n\nYes, it was enjoyable  I really like Benedict Cumberbacht, and the overall story was nice. If I had a little criticism to say, it'd be that Madd Mikelsen (an actor I really really like too) was woefully underused - or rather that his character didn;t give him a chance to really show his skill. But heck, it is a superhero movie, so if villains are a tad underdevelopped, well, that happens frequently (Loki and Magneto being counterexamples). \n\nAddendum : I want Dr Strange's cape  If we'd do Halloween in France, I  would have rushed to sew myself a similar cape, and find the equivalent to the green medallion he is wearing  Seriously, the cape, and Wong, were the two best side characters."""	2016-10-27T09:53:05	MotherofDragons
8	PetiteSheWolf	France	2650	"b'OK, so today was Day 26 of ""90 days of action"" - challenge, 70 push ups through the day. Done  (a little less proud than the burpees challenge day, but still!)\nI did 800 punches for the weekly quest- we are lagging behind, so all bees unite and ""Bee smash"" that crate open!\nAlso did the Daily dare with EC, and walked 13,817 steps.\nAnd I went over the ""50 daily dares - with EC"" bar yesterday, so the badge has a little update. Drakarys!\n\nOh, and I was forgetting the pumpkin smashing... the thing is, I really cannot lift my knees much when jumping, so my form is pretty poot, I am afraid...but I did 100. I hope it will improve during the challenge. I can hop / jog without too much trouble except cardiac rythm, but jumping both feet off the ground at the same time are an issue for me, wonder why.'"	2016-10-27T17:25:53	MotherofDragons
